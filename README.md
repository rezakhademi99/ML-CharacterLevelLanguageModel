# ML-Name Generation Project
This repository contains the implementation of two approaches for generating names: a Probabilistic Character Model and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. These models were developed as part of a machine-learning project for generating names.
# Structure
'Probabilistic Character Model.ipynb': This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the probabilistic character model.

'MLP.ipynb': This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the MLP model. It also includes expanding the MLP model by adding more neurons and increasing the size of the embedding layer.

'names.txt': This file contains the dataset used in the project, which includes approximately 32,000 names.

# Usage
1- Clone the repository to your local machine.
2- Install the required dependencies such as PyTorch and matplotlib.
3- Open either of the Jupyter notebooks (Probabilistic Character Model.ipynb or MLP.ipynb) to see the implementation of each model.
4- To run the notebooks, use the command: jupyter notebook in the terminal. Then, in the Jupyter Notebook interface opened in your browser, navigate to the cloned repository and open the desired notebook.
